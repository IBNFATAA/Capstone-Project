## Modelling
In constructing our sales analysis model in Power BI, I took a hands-on approach, personally deriving and connecting 
various components to ensure a comprehensive and tailored solution.

The model is a star schema.
There are 3 dimension tables and 1 fact table and also a **Dax measure table** containg all the dax measures. The dimension are all joined to the fact table with a one-to-many relationship.

## Visualization:

The report comprises 1 page only with fascinating and beautiful understandable visuals:

### Bit By Bit Explanation Of Visuals
In this Power BI sales analysis, I skillfully crafted a dynamic and comprehensive model. I implemented advanced measures, creating slicers for both years and category to ensure seamless interaction with the report.

This visual has a captivating rectangle fill blue color that contain the image of a slicer to the left butressing our visualization for any layman to denote we are analyzing something related to pizza, the topic also for more emphasis, and date slicer to make our interaction with the report very seamless and effortless.

The two stacked bar charts used here make it easy to recognize the piza types doing well the most (Thai Chicken) that it sales be intensify and the one that it sales have to be less produced or even put off sales in the future (Brie Carre Pizza). this visual uses bars to show profit generated by each of the pizza types and filters for easy comprehension of denoting only the best top 5 pizza and the worst bottom 5.

## Conclusion and Recommendation
The insights generated from the report shows:
- The average number of customers per day is 60, and 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. is the peak hour of sale.
- There is an average of 2 pizzas in an order, and the best-selling pizza is the Thai Chicken Pizza.
- The total profit made this year is $817.86K, and people are more interested in Thai chicken pizza.
- We should remove Brie Carre Pizza from the menu since it is the least popular pizza.
